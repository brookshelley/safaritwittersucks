safari port of Morgane's twitter sucks extension

This very basically removes everything from the Twitter webapp besides the timeline, tweet button, profile icon, search, messages, notifications, and home buttons.
The goal is to create a chill timeline free from junk like moments, "who to follow," etc.

At some point I'll pay $99 bucks so this can be permanently installed, but until then, you'll need to reinstall every time you quit safari.
